            Regarding Skyttes 1.7.8-1
        </h3>

        <p style="color: white;font-family: Poppins-Regular;">
            This is the last 1.x version. Starting with new release, they will be 2.x versions.
        </p>

        <h4 style="color: white;font-family: Poppins-Thin;margin-top: 1rem;margin-bottom: 0.2rem;">
            Why 2.x?
        </h4>

        <p style="color: white;font-family: Poppins-Regular;text-align: center;">
            First of all, with the new version I'd like to mark a new era of Skyttes.<br/>
            Skyttes will become a public open source project.
            <br/><br/>

            That's not all. The next release - 2.0, will be an complete recode.<br/>
        </p>

        <h4 style="color: white;font-family: Poppins-Thin;margin-top: 1rem;margin-bottom: 0.2rem;">
            Recode? And what about backwards compatibility?
        </h4>

        <p style="color: white;font-family: Poppins-Regular;text-align: center;">
            There will most likely be some BC breaks. Versions lower than / or 1.4 will not be able to upgrade.
            <br/>I do NOT intend to change the templating system, we will still keep Latte as our template system.
            <br/>Few times I have been asked to use Twig, BladePHP or other templating systems:
            <br/>I will not prefer these templating systems that do NOT offer something really extraordinary (which is not the case in Twig or Blade).

            <br/><br/>
            Next, I do not intend to change framework.<br/>
            Nette Framework has been in Skyttes since 1.5 and provided Skyttes with stable, reliable, secure core. 
            
            <br/>I do, however, intend to remove some Nette packages - in favor of our own or better solutions.
